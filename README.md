# Deques-Randomized-Queues
This is a project that I completed at University Of Massachusetts Boston. Practice and understanding of how to use Deques &amp; Randomized 
Queues. Deques and Queues is a project on the data structure Queues. In this project I learned about Queues and how I can specifically use
them for different purposes. One of the Queues I used is a LinkedDeque and Resizing Queue
